# x86 Assembly Codes for School Assignments

### This repository contains x86 assembly codes written for school assignments:

   * String Decryption
   * Fibonacci
   * Multiply 64-bit Numbers
   * Bubble Sort


#### For String Decryption Algorithm

Decrypt string using:

h(g(f(x))) which:

   * f(x)=2x+4EH
   * g(x)=x/2+47H
   * h(x)=xmod7BH

You should use at least 3 string instructions; using less than 3 string instructions will result in fewer points for labwork.

Hint: The value of the biggest character is 87H, and the smallest character is 17H.
