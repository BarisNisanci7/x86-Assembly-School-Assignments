x86 Assembly Codes for School Assignments

This repository contains x86 assembly codes written for school assignments:

    String Decryption
    Fibonacci
    Multiply 64-bit Numbers
    Bubble Sort

It is recommended to use EMU8086 for the development environment.


String Decryption

Decrypt string using:

h(g(f(x)))h(g(f(x))) which:

    f(x)=2x+4EHf(x)=2x+4EH
    g(x)=x/2+47Hg(x)=x/2+47H
    h(x)=xmod  7BHh(x)=xmod7BH

You should use at least 3 string instructions; using less than 3 string instructions will result in fewer points for labwork.

Hint: The value of the biggest character is 87H, and the smallest character is 17H.
